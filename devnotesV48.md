## Dev Notes - V048

- Build: V048; base on V047; add branch-level expand/collapse with persisted state and fix checkpoint text fallback.
- Branches: new chevron toggle per branch to show/hide meta + checkpoints; state stored locally; defaults expanded.
- Checkpoints: safer text fallback to avoid `[object Object]` display.
- UI: checkpoint editor wrap is scrollable/collapsible from prior build.
