## Dev Notes - V049

- Build: V049; base on V048; improve checkpoint text normalization and fix branch Edit button sizing.
- Checkpoints: stricter normalization so text always shows (fallback to strings instead of `[object Object]`).
- UI: `.btn.small` now has min-width/nowrap so the Edit button fits its text.
- No other changes.
