## Dev Notes - V047

- Synced `index.html` to the V047 modular build (`tradepro_dashboard_v047.html/.css/.js`).
- Checkpoint editor UX: added padding/background/border around the list, widened text inputs with higher-contrast styling, and expanded the “Add checkpoint” input so text stays visible while typing.
- No data/schema changes; behavior matches V046 apart from the visual improvements above.
